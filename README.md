## How It Works

- When a digit or symbol button is clicked, the value is displayed on the screen.
- Operators are normalized internally:
  - `×` → `*`
  - `÷` → `/`
  - `−` → `-`
- When `=` is clicked:
  - The expression is evaluated using JavaScript.
  - The result is **rounded to 6 decimal places** if it is a floating-point number.
- Clicking **C (clear)** resets the calculator's state and screen.
